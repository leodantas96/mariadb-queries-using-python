# mariadb-queries-using-python
In this project, I used 1 programming language (Python) and 1 database engine (MariaDB). The main purpose of this project was to print the MariaDB queries data in Anaconda Powershell inside tables.  It is just a beginner project made at School but I hope you enjoy it!

In order to use this project, you will need to have: <br>
--> Python 3.9 version installed;<br>
--> MyMariaDB 10.6.5 version installed<br>

Specific of MariaDB file:<br>
--> In order to use "tabulate", a pip install tabulate is required;<br>
--> In order to use the database, you will need to change the settings defined in connectionDB;<br>

Specific of Python file:<br>
--> You will need to change the queries since they were designed based on my database information.<br>
